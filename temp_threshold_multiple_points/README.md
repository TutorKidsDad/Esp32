# Summary: Temperature Monitoring System

This project implements a **temperature monitoring system** using **ESP32**, **ESP8266**, or **Arduino Uno**, along with a **DS18B20 temperature sensor**, a **16x2 I2C LCD**, and a **buzzer**. The system continuously monitors the temperature and triggers different alerts based on predefined temperature thresholds.


## Purpose
The system's main objectives are:
- Monitor temperature using the **DS18B20** sensor.
- Display real-time temperature data on a **16x2 I2C LCD**.
- Trigger distinct buzzer alerts at different temperature stages.

## Components
1. **Microcontroller**: Works with ESP32, ESP8266, or Arduino Uno.
2. **DS18B20 Sensor**: Measures the temperature.
3. **16x2 I2C LCD**: Displays the temperature and warning messages.
4. **Buzzer**: Sounds an alert when the temperature crosses set thresholds.

## Key Features
- **Temperature Thresholds**: 
  - **Below 70°C**: Heating phase.
  - **70°C to 80°C**: Stage-1 alert.
  - **80°C to 90°C**: Stage-2 alert.
  - **90°C to 100°C**: Stage-3 alert.
  - **Above 100°C**: Critical Stage-4 alert.
  
- **Alerts**: Different buzzer sounds based on the temperature stage.
- **Display**: The LCD shows temperature data and the current alert stage.

## Setup and Loop Functions
- **Setup**: Initializes the sensor, LCD, and buzzer.
- **Loop**: Continuously reads temperature and triggers appropriate alerts based on thresholds.

## Applications
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Detect overheating in machinery.
- **Home Automation**: Regulate heating and cooling systems.
- **Agriculture**: Monitor greenhouse temperatures.
- **Safety Systems**: Provide critical temperature alerts.

This system is flexible across different platforms and can be extended for cloud-based data logging or automation.
