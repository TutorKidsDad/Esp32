This code controls two servo motors using an ESP32 microcontroller. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

### Setup:
1. **Servo Library (`<ESP32Servo.h>`)**: The code includes a library for controlling servos on the ESP32.
2. **Servo Objects**: Two servo objects (`myservo1` and `myservo2`) are created, allowing control over two individual servo motors.
3. **Pin Assignments**: Servos are connected to pins 13 and 12 of the ESP32, respectively.
4. **PWM Timers**: The ESP32 has 4 timers (0 to 3) that are allocated for controlling the servo motors' PWM signals.
5. **Servo Frequency**: The standard PWM signal frequency for hobby servos is set to 50 Hz (standard for most servo motors).
6. **Attach Servos**: The servos are attached to their designated pins with a pulse width range of 500 to 2400 microseconds, which defines their movement range from 0° to 180°.

### Loop:
- **First Servo (`myservo1`)**: 
    - The first `for` loop moves the first servo (attached to pin 13) from 0° to 180° in 1° increments. Each movement is delayed by 15 ms to ensure the servo has time to reach the desired position.
    - The second `for` loop then moves the servo back from 180° to 0°, again with a 1° step and 15 ms delay between steps.
  
- **Second Servo (`myservo2`)**: 
    - Similarly, the next two `for` loops control the second servo (attached to pin 12), sweeping it from 0° to 180° and back to 0°, with the same delays.

### Purpose:
The code continuously sweeps both servo motors from 0° to 180° and back, creating a smooth back-and-forth motion. Each loop iteration makes the servos move at a controlled pace by stepping 1° at a time with short delays.
