Here's a detailed explanation of what the ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitor project does, covering its functionality, components, and overall purpose:

### Project Overview
The **ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitor** is an Internet of Things (IoT) project that utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller and an SHT31 sensor to monitor environmental conditionsâ€”specifically temperature and humidity. This data can be visualized in real time through a web interface hosted on the ESP32 itself, and it can also be sent to **ThingSpeak**, an IoT analytics platform, for further analysis and visualization.

### Key Features
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The project continuously reads temperature and humidity data from the SHT31 sensor and displays it on a web page. Users can access this page via a web browser from any device connected to the ESP32's network.

2. **Web Interface**: The ESP32 hosts a simple web server that serves an HTML page showing the current temperature and humidity readings. This interface is user-friendly and designed for easy access.

3. **Data Logging on ThingSpeak**: The ESP32 sends the gathered data to ThingSpeak using its API. This allows users to view historical data trends and create graphs for better understanding and analysis of the environmental conditions over time.

4. **Access Point (AP) Mode**: If the ESP32 cannot connect to a specified WiFi network, it automatically creates its own access point. Users can connect to this network to access the web interface, ensuring easy access even in remote locations without a stable internet connection.

### Components Used
- **ESP32 Development Board**: A powerful microcontroller with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT applications.
- **SHT31 Sensor**: A digital temperature and humidity sensor that provides accurate readings of environmental conditions.
- **WiFi Module**: The ESP32's built-in WiFi allows for easy connectivity to local networks and the ability to send data to external servers.

### Code Functionality
The code is structured into several key sections, including:
- **Library Inclusions**: Essential libraries such as `Wire` (for I2C communication with the SHT31), `TaskScheduler` (for managing tasks), `ESP8266WiFi`, and `ESP8266WebServer` (for handling WiFi and HTTP requests).
  
- **Global Variables**: Variables to hold WiFi credentials, ThingSpeak API keys, sensor data (temperature and humidity), and to manage connection states.

- **Setup Function**: Initializes the Serial communication, configures the I2C for the sensor, sets up the web server endpoints, and enables scheduled tasks for periodic readings and data sending.

- **Loop Function**: Continuously checks and executes scheduled tasks to read sensor data, serve web pages, and send data to ThingSpeak.

- **Task Callbacks**: Functions that handle specific tasks:
  - **I2C Task**: Reads data from the SHT31 sensor.
  - **WiFi Task**: Connects to WiFi and sends data to ThingSpeak.
  - **AP Task**: Manages the web server when the device is in access point mode.

- **Web Server Handlers**: Functions to respond to HTTP requests, serving HTML pages that display the current temperature and humidity readings and provide links for further information.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of how to create an IoT device that can monitor environmental conditions. It serves educational purposes, helping users learn about sensor integration, data communication, and web development in the context of IoT. The ability to visualize data on ThingSpeak adds a valuable dimension to data analysis, making it suitable for applications such as home automation, agriculture monitoring, and environmental research.

### Conclusion
The **ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitor** is a versatile and educational project that combines hardware and software skills to create a functional IoT application. It showcases the capabilities of the ESP32 and various sensors while providing a practical solution for real-time environmental monitoring.
